# Validator Whitelist

The aLuna contract keeps a whitelist of validators, only permitting delegations to those included in the whitelist. This is crucial since all aLuna tokens equally share slashing risks, and delegations to low-performing validators could negatively affect all holders. The whitelist include only this validator for now. More will be added as the protocol matures. Rules to adding a validator will be written according to other protocols' and community's standard.
